## 🔍 **3. Depth-wise Analysis**

This section explains the architectural decisions, internal logic, and technical structuring behind **AcadVault2.0**.

---

### 🧩 **How It Works**

AcadVault2.0 runs as a **serverless static web application** powered by **Next.js** using **Static Site Generation (SSG)**. It does not rely on a database or backend; instead, it uses structured `.json` files to simulate a lightweight data layer.

Key functional workflows:

- **Homepage** fetches resource data from JSON and renders it using dynamic React components
- **Upload page** simulates file submission, allowing users to input metadata (mock functionality for now)
- **Course-specific pages** are statically generated from course codes and render only relevant materials
- **Filtering & Searching** allow users to refine resources by tags, course, and title
- **LocalStorage** is used for features like recent views or bookmarks (fully client-side)

---

### 🛠 **Implementation Details**

#### ⚙️ **Architecture & Design**

- **Component-Based Architecture**  
  Modular components like `Navbar`, `UploadForm`, and `ResourceCard` ensure reusability and maintainability

- **Responsive & Accessible Design**  
  Built with Tailwind CSS, responsive across devices, and follows accessibility guidelines (semantic HTML, ARIA roles, color contrast)

- **Folder Structure for Scalability**  
  Clear separation into `components/`, `pages/`, `utils/`, and `data/` helps organize logic and scale the app

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**  
  Next.js builds the app statically for performance, SEO, and low hosting costs

- **Open Contribution Workflow**  
  Easy to contribute via GitHub issues and PRs, with CI tools (GitHub Actions) integrated

---

### 🧠 **Data Structures and Storage**

#### 1. **JSON-Based Storage**
Used to store:
- Resources (`resourceData.json`)
- Courses (`courses.json`)
- Tags (`tags.json`)

Easily extendable and ideal for static generation.

#### 2. **Object-Oriented Modeling**

- **Resource Object**: Contains title, description, course code, file URL, tags, uploader, date, etc.
- **Course Object**: Maps course codes to descriptive names
- **Tag Object**: Standardizes tag-based filtering

#### 3. **Array Structures**
Resources, tags, and courses are stored as arrays of objects, allowing:
- Easy mapping in React
- Filtering, sorting, and pagination using native JS

#### 4. **Client-Side LocalStorage**
Stores:
- Recently viewed resources
- Bookmarks
- (In future) Preferences like theme mode or user history

Lightweight, persistent, and works without backend storage.

### 🧠 Summary of Design Rationale

| Design Element     | Reasoning                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JSON files         | Lightweight, version-controlled, ideal for static frontend builds        |
| Object arrays      | Easy integration with JavaScript and React components                    |
| Tag & Course maps  | Enhance organization and enable filterable UI                            |
| LocalStorage       | Offers a minimal client-side state layer for better UX                   |

## 🚀 **5. Suggested Improvements**

To further enhance the functionality and academic value of AcadVault2.0, the following features are proposed for future versions:

---

- 🔍 **Advanced Search & Filtering**  
  Enable users to search by course code, tags, resource type (notes, papers, reports), semester, or faculty.

---

- 🔐 **User Authentication**  
  Implement login/logout and user profiles. This will enable:
  - Upload tracking
  - Personalized bookmarks
  - Contributor recognition

---

- ⭐ **Rating and Review System**  
  Allow students to upvote/downvote or leave feedback on resources, helping others find the most helpful materials.

---

- ❓ **Quiz Format Support (Planned)**  
  Introduce a new content type for multiple-choice quizzes and self-assessment modules.  
  This will:
  - Allow students to create or upload quizzes
  - Display quizzes using interactive components (e.g., select options, instant feedback)
  - Track progress locally (initially with localStorage; expandable to backend later)

---

- 🏷️ **Question Tagging System (Planned)**  
  Add the ability to tag uploaded question papers with metadata like:
  - 📅 Year of exam
  - 🧪 Type (Midsem, Endsem, Quiz, Lab test)
  - 📚 Course topics or concepts covered
  - ⚙️ Difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard)

  These tags will make old papers more searchable, sortable, and user-relevant.

---

- 📱 **Mobile Optimization & PWA**  
  Optimize for mobile screens and consider turning the platform into a Progressive Web App for offline access.
